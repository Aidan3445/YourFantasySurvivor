# Your Fantasy Survivor
#### The most customizable Fantasy Survivor league hosting service.

## Your League, Your Way
When you create a `league` you can choose the point value of rewards, immunities, or advantage plays/misplays. 
But you can also define your own! 
* Points for pulling off a blindside?
* Points off for swearing?
* Points for anything you want!
You can also define season or semi-season (pre/post-merge) `side bet` predictions such as 'Most Individual Immunities' to add to your total if it hits.

And you can set weekly picks like 'Who is going home' or 'Who will say the episode title' so you can stay in the season even if your survivor is out.

## We Get to Vote Too
When you create a custom point `category`, you can open the events to a vote from your league or give yourself as the admin unilateral power to decide. 
Customizable doesn't need to mean fair...

Certain events, like orchestrating a blindside, might be popular enough categories that they get opened up to the community. 
When this happens, all players in a league with that event in their scoring system will have the opportunity to vote for the players they think deserve the credit.

When the next episode airs, the outcome of the votes for the previous week will be announced and points will be added. Don't worry, you can give yourself or your league veto power to change or negate the outcome of the vote if you can't take the heat.

## Run your league differently?
Let us know! The goal of this site is to make it as easy as possible for us as fans to put ourselves into the game from the comfort of our couches. 
If you think a feature is missing or there's an entirely different way to run a league that we missed, tell us and we will make it happen!
