#### The most customizable Fantasy Survivor league hosting service.

## Welcome to Your Fantasy Survivor!  

Compete with friends in *Your Fantasy Survivor*, the ultimate Survivor fantasy league.  

### How It Works  
- **Create your own league**, draft a Survivor, and rack up points as they navigate the game.  
- **Score points** for their victories, bold moves, and even the chaos they create.  
- **Change your pick at any time** — switch to any remaining castaway if your Survivor gets eliminated, or shake things up with a strategic swap.  
- **Customize your league’s scoring system**, create unique events, and make the game your own.  

**Outdraft your rivals. Outpredict the game. Outwatch every moment.**  

When the next episode airs, the outcome of the votes for the previous week will be announced and points will be added. Don't worry, you can give yourself or your league veto power to change or negate the outcome of the vote if you can't take the heat.

## Run your league differently?
Let us know! The goal of this site is to make it as easy as possible for us as fans to put ourselves into the game from the comfort of our couches. 
If you think a feature is missing or there's an entirely different way to run a league that we missed, tell us and we will make it happen!
